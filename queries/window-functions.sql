SELECT region, product_id, product_name, total_revenue, rnk
FROM (
  SELECT c.region,
         p.product_id,
         p.name AS product_name,

ORDER BY region, rnk;
 2. Aggregate Functions 
SELECT month,

       SUM(monthly_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
FROM (
